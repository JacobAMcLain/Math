# Math

Code that can perform many math related operations

The classes that I am the most proud of as of now are BlackJack and BasicOperations

OUTLINE OF THE PROJECT

------------------------------
## package - derivatives 
- EMPTY AS OF NOW
------------------------------
## package - integrals
- EMPTY AS OF NOW
------------------------------
## package - operations
- AbsoluteValue.java - Computes the absolute value of a scanned double
- **BasicOperations.java - Can compute basic operations (+,-,*,/, and %) two at a time. Similar to a phone          calculator**
- Factorial.java - Scans an int and prints out what its factorial is
- Roots.java - Scans an int and a double from user to tell nth root and number underneath the radicand            respectively
------------------------------
## package - rng
- BlackJack.java - Simulates a game of BlackJack (21) where you can hit or stay                                   (Could add opponents/AI feature later)**
- DiceRoller.java - Simulates a roll of an n sided dice determined by the user
- Rng__to___.java - User picks upper and lower bounds and program gives a random number between the two bounds
------------------------------
## package - shapes
- AreaCircleCalc.java - Calculates the area of a circle given its radius or diameter (user can pick r or d)
- AreaRectangleCalc.java - Calculates the area of a rectangle given the length of 2 sides by the user
- AreaSquareCalc.java - Calculates the area of a square given the side length by the user
- CubeVolumeCalc.java - Calculates the volume of a cube given the side length by the user
- CylinderVolumeCalc.java - Calculates the volume of a cylinder (similar to AreaCircle, just adds a height        feature)
- Pythag.java - Calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle given 2 leg lengths by user
- SphereVolumeCalc.java - Calculates the volume of a sphere given radius or diameter by user
------------------------------
## package - sorters
- NameSorter.java - Sorts a list of names given by the user
- NumberSorter.java - Sorts a list of numbers given by the user
